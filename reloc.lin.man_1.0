********** USERS GUIDE:  COMPLOC EARTHQUAKE LOCATION PACKAGE **********

This describes the programs included in the COMPLOC package, which
are designed for local earthquake locations.  They have been tested
on data from the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) and 
Northern California Earthquake Data Center.


Before beginning, it is necessary to have the following:


(1) A one-dimensional velocity vs. depth model for the region.

Here is the format:

z or r     Vp        Vs    (DON'T INCLUDE THIS HEADER LINE!)

 0.0       4.0      2.31   (START WITH THIS LINE)
 6.0       6.2      3.58
32.0       6.8      3.93
32.0       7.8      4.50
60.0       7.9      4.56

The spacing is arbitrary in the file; a fixed column format is not required.
The first column can be either depth or radius in km.  The next two columns
are the P and S wave velocities in km/s.  A linear velocity gradient is assummed
between model points.  In this case there is a velocity discontinuity at 32 km.
For crustal models such as this one, a slight velocity gradient should be used
for the upper mantle to assure that Pn and Sn arrivals will be obtained.

Notice that one can also input a "layer cake" model such as the Hadley-Kanamori
model for southern California:

0.0   5.5  3.18
5.5   5.5  3.18
5.5   6.3  3.64
16.0  6.3  3.64
16.0  6.7  3.87
32.0  6.7  3.87
32.0  7.8  4.50
40.0  7.83 4.52

Notice, however, that a slight velocity gradient is put into the lowermost layer
so that the program will generate rays for Pn and Sn. 


(2) A list of station names, their locations and station corrections if available.

Example:

CI BAR  EHZ   32.68005  -116.67215     496.0    0.00    0.00
CI BRG  EHZ   33.17139  -116.17470     205.0    0.00    0.00
CI CAH  EHZ   33.49296  -116.72386    1313.0    0.00    0.00
CI COY  EHZ   33.36296  -116.31114     218.0    0.00    0.00
CI CPM  EHZ   34.15442  -116.19771     897.0    0.00    0.00

The station location file format is:

col  len  format    name        comment
---  ---  ------    ----        -------
 1    2     a2      net         network id
 4    4     a4      stname      station name
 9    3     a3      comp        component (but not used in our location programs)
13   10     f10.5   slat        station latitude
23   12     f12.5   slon        station longitude
35   10     f10.1   selev       station elevation (but not used in our programs)
45   16     2f8.2   stterm(2)   prior station corrections at each station (1 for P, 2 for S)

This is a fixed column format; you MUST put everything
in the correct columns.  The program uses only the
network id and station name to identify and locate
stations.  This file should have no more than 5000
lines.  It is not required that the file be in
alphabetical order but this is recommended for your
own convenience. (In UNIX, just enter "sort -name
filename -print filename.srt" to obtain a sorted
version.)


(3) Phase pick data for the events to be located

These can be in one of three possible formats:
   (a) BED3, our own special binary format
   (b) SCSN STP phase data
   (c) NCEDC HYPOINVERSE phase data
   
For large data sets, we recommend that formats (b) and (c) 
be converted to (a) using our conversion programs (see below) 
because the BED3 format is much faster to read.  However, if 
desired (b) and (c) can be used directly in the location program.


The programs are as follows:

VZFILLIN  resamples velocity model to finer depth intervals
          (should be run before DEPTABLE)

DEPTABLE  computes tables of travel time, ray angle, ray
          parameter and vertical slowness at source as a 
          function of source depth for both local and global
	  seismic velocity models.  These output tables are 
	  designed to be read with the GET_TTS subroutine.
	  
PHASE2BED3  converts from SCSN STP or Hypoinverse to
            BED3 format for storing pick data
	       
COMPLOC   performs locations using grid search method
          Implements "shrinking box" source-specific station
          term (SSST) method (if desired).  Results are output
	  into one of five possible formats.
	  
	  
Recommended user sequence:

(1) Create vz model and run VZFILLIN to resample to
    1-km (or 0.5-km)  depth interval
    
(2) Run DEPTABLE to create tables necessary for COMPLOC

(3) Use PHASE_TO_BED3 to convert phase pick data to BED3 format

(4) Run COMPLOC to compute locations


------------------------------------ VZFILLIN --------------------------------

vzfillin.f is a utility program that reads (z, Vp, Vs) model files and resamples
them at any desired finer depth interval.  This is done with linear interpolation.
It also permits generating S velocities that are a specified fraction of the P
velocities.

Example:

vz.shlk1

    etc.


----------------------------------- DEPTABLE -------------------------------

deptable.f is a f77 program that computes tables of travel time, ray angle,
ray parameter, and vertical slowness at the source as a function of source 
depth and source-receiver distance. It can be used for both local and global 
seismic models because an Earth flattening transformation is applied to the 
velocity model prior to the ray tracing.  The output tables are designed to 
be read with the GET_TTS subroutine.

An input velocity model is required in the following format:

z or r     Vp        Vs

 0.0       4.0      2.31
 6.0       6.2      3.58
32.0       6.8      3.93
32.0       7.8      4.50
60.0       7.9      4.56

The first column can be either depth or radius in km.  The next two columns
are the P and S wave velocities in km/s.  A linear velocity gradient is assummed
between model points.  In this case there is a velocity discontinuity at 32 km.
For crustal models such as this one, a slight velocity gradient should be used
for the upper mantle to assure that Pn and Sn arrivals will be obtained.

Notice that one can also input a "layer cake" model such as the Hadley-Kanamori
model for southern California:


0.0   5.5  3.18
5.5   5.5  3.18
5.5   6.3  3.64
16.0  6.3  3.64
16.0  6.7  3.87
32.0  6.7  3.87
32.0  7.8  4.50
40.0  7.83 4.52

Notice, however, that a slight velocity gradient is put into the lowermost layer
so that the program will generate rays for Pn and Sn.

IMPORTANT:  deptable will only give results for source depths that correspond
to a specified depth in the input model.  These example input files are not finely 
sampled in depth and thus are not suited for the example shown below in which
results are output at 1 km depth intervals.  Use the VZFILLIN program to resample
your input model to a finer depth sampling before running deptable.


Here is an example of running the deptable program:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Comments:

The maximum depth input can be used if a reflected phase, such as PmP or PcP,
is desired.

Source depths can either be specified exactly or as a range of equally spaced
depths.  IMPORTANT:  ALL OF THESE DEPTHS MUST CORRESPOND TO A LINE IN THE INPUT
VELOCITY MODEL (use the vzfillin program to add lines to your input velocity
model)

The minimum ray parameter is always set to zero so that vertically travelling rays 
from events at depth are included.  The maximum value is set to the reciprocal of
the surface velocity in the model.  Unless speed is important, a large number of rays 
should be used.  The program maximum is 40000 rays.

If desired, the ray table output file gives the surface-to-surface x and t results 
for all values of the ray  parameter.  This may be useful in some case for debugging 
and other purposes.

The output ray angles at the source are from vertical, 0 is upgoing vertical, 90 is 
horizontal, 135 is downgoing at a 45 degree angle, etc.

The output values of ray parameter are negative for upgoing rays from the source
and positive for downgoing rays from the source.

The program sets zero values of Vs in the input velocity model to Vp.  This kluge
means that a specified core S phase will automatically generate SKS.

The program only outputs the first-arriving branches of triplicated phases.  Because
Pn and Sn are so weak in most local earthquake data sets, these phases can be
supressed by giving a suitable value for the minimum p at long range (as in the
above example).  This results in tables that include Pg out to ranges beyond the
Pg/Pn cross-over distance.

The results are only approximate for layer cake (constant velocity layer) models 
because the results are interpolated between adjacent values of ray parameter p.
However, when a large number of rays are used, the inaccuracies are relatively
small. 




------------------------------------ PHASE_TO_BED3 --------------------------------
We recommend converting phase data file from the network into our BED3 file which is 
a binary file. It is much faster to read phase data in BED3 format than the direct 
phase format, especially for large data sets.

We provide phase_to.bed3.f which is a f77 program that can convert SCSN catalog phase data
and NCSN HYPOINVERSE phase data into BED3 format.

Examples:

(1) SCSN STP phase data to bed3 file

 nq,npickall =  1621 46772   ! number of quakes and picks
 
 
Phase data files phaselist.scsn and phaselist.ncsn are in this directory.

NOTE: Be aware of that there should be only one line following the last pick 
in the phaselist.stp file.




 ------------------------------------ COMPLOC --------------------------------
 
comploc is the f77 program that implements the source-specific location method.
Before running comploc, you must already have the P and S travel time table files,
the station location file, and the phase pick file.  Note that you must have
starting locations for the events in the phase pick file; comploc is not
designed to locate events without any prior location estimates.

Because of the number of required inputs, we recommend always running comploc
using a UNIX script (command file).  In the examples, these are the "do" files.

Here is an example of running the program, followed by a more detailed explanation
of the various inputs:

First, the program asks for the required input file names.  The phase data are permitted in one
of three different formats, including the binary bed3 format.  Five different output formats for
the locations are permitted, including our own special format (option 5).

The distance cutoff permits rejection of phase data from stations beyond a maximum
distance (km) from the event.  Often data at longer distances are less reliable due 
to Pg/Pn ambiguities or defects in the velocity model.  We have generally used a 100 km
cutoff for our California location work.  Comparing results using different distance cutoffs
is a good test of the velocity model.  If the event depths change significantly when a 
50 km cutoff is used compared to a 100 km cutoff, then the mid to lower crustal velocities
in the model are likely too fast or too slow.  A clue that this may be happening is when a
mainshock locates at a  different depth from its aftershocks; larger events typically have
phase picks extending to larger distances than smaller events.

npick_min sets a mininum number of phase picks in order to locate an event.  Obviously at
least four picks are required to solve for (x,y,z,t).  We recommend setting this to at
least five.  Larger numbers will restrict the locations to only the better recorded events.

A lat/lon window options permits locating a geographic subset of your dataset.  Units are
decimal degrees.  Use negative numbers for west longitudes, i.e. California is at -120 longitude.

Normally, the fixed loc kluge option should not be used as it does not produce new locations.
The fixed location kluge option permits keeping the location fixed at the (x,y,z) location given
in the phase file.  The program will then only vary the origin time of the events to achieve
the best fit.  This option can be useful to compute station terms for a given set of locations
with respect to a particular 1-D velocity model.  For example, if one has locations available
from a joint-hypocenter velocity (JHV) inversion that are believed to be accurate, this option can 
be used to compute a set of station terms that will yield similar absolute locations using the
comploc program (this will require a separate run of comploc using the station terms as input).  
The advantage is that additional events (not in the JHV catalog) can be located and the SSST
method should improve the relative location accuracy of all of the events.

The starting reference depth is the center point for the grid search method.  If a fixed depth
is used (as in this example), then another input line is required to specify the depth.
Except for rare, pathological events that confuse the grid search approach, the location results 
should not be sensitive to this depth.  10 km is a good starting depth because the grid
search method starts with a box of +- 10 km.

For testing purposes, one can locate fewer than the total number of events by specifying a
maximum number of events to locate.  One can also specify a random fraction of the total
events to locate.  For example, entering 0.1 for the random fraction would cause the program
to randomly select 10% of the input events.

The program works by performing a number of iterations of event location and station term
calculation.  There are two types of stations terms.  Static station terms are a single number
for each station and phase (P or S).  They are computed as the mean (or median) of the residuals
for each station.  The source-specific station terms (SSST) are specific to each event and are 
computed by smoothing the residuals over adjacent events.  The best results are generally obtained
by first solving for static stations terms and then solving for source-specific station terms
using a residual smoothing box that decreases in size with each iteration.  The program permits
the user to vary the number of iterations used at each step and the size of the smoothing box
for the SSST calculation.

In this example, 5 iterations are used to compute the static station terms and 10 are used for
the SSST.  At each SSST iteration the terms are computed by smoothing over nmed adjacent events,
located within a distance dismax of each target event.  In this example, nmed = 1000 and dismax
= 20 (km) at the first iteration.  At the last (10th iteration), nmed = 20 and dismax = 5 (km).
nmed and dismax are set to intermediate values for iterations 2 to 9 (these are evenly spaced
in log(nmed) and log(dismax)).  The parameters used here work pretty well for our California
locations but users may wish to experiment with different choices.  The general strategy is
to gradually decrease the number of events used in smoothing the residuals for the SSST calculation.
The longer wavelength structure in the residual field helps to improve the absolute location
accuracy; the shorter wavelength structure provides the best relative location accuracy among
nearby events.  Even if the primary control on the SSST smoothing is provided by nmed, suitable
choices for dismax can make the program run faster.  This is because sorting by distance is
required to identify the closest nmed events.  Sorting is a computer intensive process for
large data sets (> 100,000 events) so using dismax to restrict the number of events to be sorted
is a good idea.

The grid search location method searches for the smallest residuals as defined by the (1) the
L1-norm (median), (2) L2-norm (least squares, mean), or (3) robust mean (L2 with outlier suppression).
We generally recommend the use of (1) or (3) because they are relatively insensitive to gross picking
and timing errors, unless you are confident that your picks are outlier free.  For consistency, 
this choice of norm also controls how the station terms are computed (1=median residual,
2= mean residual, 3=robust mean residual).   Note: the robust mean estimates the mean uses L2 
for residuals less than 0.1 s and L1 for residuals greater than 0.1 s.

The grid search location method is iterative.  At each iteration, it checks 27 locations in a 3x3x3
cube centered on the current best location.  The location with the smallest residual becomes the new
current location and the cube shrinks by a user specified fraction (0.67 in this example).  The starting
cube is 20 km across (+- 10 km from the starting location).  The nominal location precision is
determined by the number of iterations and the fractional reduction parameter.  In this case, this
precision is 10*0.67^15 = 0.0246 km = 25 m.  Faster results can be obtained by using 0.5 rather than
0.67 and a smaller number of iterations; however the grid search performs somewhat less reliably
in this case for "problem" events (if the misfit function is very elongated, the minimum may fall
between grid points and the program may not converge to the true minimum residual solution).  


Note:

(1) Travel time tables, ray parameter tables and vertical slowness tables
are generated using deptable.f program.

(2) We give users choices of output location file format.
