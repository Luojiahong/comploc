COMPLOC is a computer program package for relocating earthquakes

The orginal sources of this code are available from the [homepage of Goquing Lin] (https://www.rsmas.miami.edu/users/glin/COMPLOC.html).

This GitHub repo is mainly used to evidence the changes I've made to the "1.01" version and to try to move towards a more usable solution (python based, of course) to use the code(s).

If, ever, you use the modified version, please acknowledge it together with the original articles:
